# 🏸 Badminton Match Analysis (BWF World Tour 2018–2021)

This project analyzes 6,736 professional badminton matches from the BWF World Tour between 2018 and 2021. It explores trends in match competitiveness, country performance, player behavior, and includes a predictive model for identifying whether a match will go to three sets.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Understand competitive patterns across men's and women's singles
- Analyze country dominance and tournament-level differences
- Explore how match characteristics influence competitiveness
- Build a predictive model to classify 2-set vs 3-set matches
- Communicate insights through clear visuals and explanations
