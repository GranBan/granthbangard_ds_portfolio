# granthbangard_data-science_portfolio
A portfolio of Data Science and ML projects where I explore data, build models, and explain insights in a clear, practical way. Each project walks through the full workflow, from cleaning and visualization to feature engineering and prediction using Python. Built to showcase my hands-on approach to analytics and readiness for internships in DS/ML.
