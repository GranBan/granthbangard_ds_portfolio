# granthbangard_ds_portfolio
A portfolio of Data Science and ML projects where I explore data, build models, and explain insights in a clear, practical way. Each project walks through the full workflow, from cleaning and visualization to feature engineering and prediction using Python. Built to showcase my hands-on approach to analytics and readiness for internships in DS/ML.


## Projects

### 1. Badminton Match Analysis | BWF World Tour 2018–2021
- Analyzed **6,736 professional badminton matches** to study country dominance, match competitiveness, and COVID-era disruptions.
- Built a **logistic regression model** to predict whether a match goes to **3 sets**.
- Performed end-to-end analysis including EDA, visualizations (bar, line, box plots), feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Key Insights:
  - Men’s singles go to 3 sets ~35% of the time; women’s singles ~30%.
  - China dominates women’s singles; India & Denmark lead men’s singles.
  - COVID-19 caused an ~83% drop in matches in 2020 vs. 2019.

### 2. Customer Churn Analysis and Retention Intelligence
- Built a **business-focused churn intelligence system** to identify high-risk users and key behavioral drivers of churn.
- Achieved **82% accuracy**, identifying **35% of high-risk customers**, enabling targeted retention strategies.
- Performed end-to-end analysis: **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering**, and **machine learning modeling** optimized for recall and **ROC-AUC**.
- Translated model outputs into actionable retention strategies by customer risk segment that could **reduce churn by ~12–15%**, bridging predictive analytics with real-world business decisions.
