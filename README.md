# granthbangard_ds_portfolio
A portfolio of Data Science and ML projects where I explore data, build models, and explain insights in a clear, practical way. Each project walks through the full workflow, from cleaning and visualization to feature engineering and prediction using Python. Built to showcase my hands-on approach to analytics and readiness for internships in DS/ML.

## Projects

### 1. Badminton Match Analysis | BWF World Tour 2018–2021
- Analyzed 6,736 professional badminton matches to study country dominance, match competitiveness, and COVID-era disruptions.
- Built a logistic regression model to predict whether a match goes to 3 sets.
- Includes EDA, visualizations (bar, line, box plots), feature engineering, and model evaluation.

### 2. Customer Churn Analysis and Retention Intelligence | Ongoing
- Building a business-focused churn intelligence system using subscription customer data to identify high-risk users and key behavioral drivers of churn.
- Performing end-to-end analysis including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and will perform feature engineering, and machine learning modeling optimization for recall and ROC-AUC rather than accuracy.
- Planning to translate model outputs into unique actionable retention strategies by customer risk segment, bridging predictive analytics with real-world business decision-making.
